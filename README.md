[Live Demo](https://msosadev.github.io/treehouse-project-7/)

Technologies used:
* HTML/CSS
* Javascript
* Chart.js

This is the seventh project in the Treehouse frontend development techdegree. It meant to test my skills in CSS grid, flexbox and the implementation of external JS plugins, such as Chart.js. It consists of a dashboard view with various widgets that summarize the social analytics gathered with the app.

The user can also see the activity of other users as well as send them a message.

Finally, there's a settings widget that saves any changes into the local storage, so the user can close the app, return in some other time and still have the same settings.
